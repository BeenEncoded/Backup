### Backup

This software was meant to create copies of folders quickly and efficiently.  It fills a couple of criteria that I wanted from a backup:  
1.  It can backup to multiple drives at the same time, while only reading from the origin file once.  
2.  The backups can be accessed without the software, and 'restored' anywhere you want.  
  
The software is easily configurable, and while it has more than a few issues it is still quite effective.
